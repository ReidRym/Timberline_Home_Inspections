We will meticulously examine the construction work, plumbing, electrical systems, and other components to identify any defects or issues that may need attention, providing the buyer with peace of mind regarding the newly constructed property.

In these instances we perform a comprehensive evaluation of the roof using a drone, at no additional charge to the buyer.  This innovative approach allows us to capture detailed images and footage, providing a thorough analysis of the roof's condition, potential damage, and overall structural integrity from a unique perspective.</p>

          <div class="accordion-body">
            Answer 2:<br><br>&ensp; Once the report is finished and generated you will be emailed a link that gives you access to an easy-to-read, user friendly web report.  From that web report you can also choose to view it as a PDF for printing or downloading.  We find the web report much easier to read and navigate.  All reports are completed within 24 hours of the inspection, oftentimes we are able to provide the report to you the same day as the inspection.

          </button>
        </h2>
        <div id="answer3" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="question3" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
          <div class="accordion-body">
            Answer 3:<br><br>&ensp;It depends on the conditions of the real estate market and the inspector that you choose. Most sales agreements stipulate a certain number of days within which a home inspection must be completed (typically 10), to ensure timely inspections and avoid any delays in the closing process.<br><br>

            &ensp;The home inspection itself usually takes about 2-4 hours, depending on the size of home, condition, and add-on services selected.  During this time the home inspector will check all of the major systems of the house. For larger homes, this process will take longer – for small homes and condos, it may only take 2 hours.<br><br>
            
            &ensp;You are welcomed and encouraged to accompany the inspector during this time, to ensure that you understand any issues they may report. After the inspection is done, a complete home inspection report will be sent to you within 24 hours.
            
            &ensp;This report will summarize all of the major findings of the home inspection, ensuring that both parties understand what the home inspector has found.

          <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer4">
            Question 4: Do Home Inspectors Check Appliances?
          </button>
        </h2>
        <div id="answer4" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="question4" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
          <div class="accordion-body">
            Answer 4:<br><br>&ensp; Each home inspector operates at a minimum to the Arizona Standards of Practice.  The answer is “Yes” – but with a catch.  During home inspections, your home inspector will examine “Major Appliances”. They will check all of the major appliances that will be sold with the home, such as:<br><br>

           - Water heaters<br>
            -Furnaces<br>
           - HVAC systems<br><br>
           &ensp; As our own, "in-house" standard of practice rule, any appliance that is “built-in”, such as a microwave that cannot be removed, or any appliance that will be sold with the home is tested for function. However, it’s important to understand the limitations of this inspection process.<br><br>
            
           &ensp;Most major appliances will simply be tested for basic functionality. For example, the inspector may turn on the oven to make sure that it heats up, or test all of the burners on a range, to ensure that they are all active, and operating properly. Or, they may check to make sure that the dishwasher turns on.<br><br>
            
           &ensp;We are only concerned with general functionality – whether or not an appliance turns on, and has basic functionality. If you want a more in-depth appraisal, you will have to hire an appliance technician, which will carry an additional fee. However, this may be worth the price, particularly if the home has custom, built-in kitchen appliances which may be very costly to repair or replace.<br><br>
            
           &ensp;So, the short answer to this question is “Yes.” The long answer is that each inspector will have a different operating procedure and limitations for checking "small" appliance

      <!-- Question 5 -->
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="question5">
          <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer5">
            Question 5: What To Do During a Home Inspection?
          </button>
        </h2>
        <div id="answer5" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="question5" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
          <div class="accordion-body">
            Answer 5:<br><br>&ensp; This is a question we get all the time. The answer is different for everyone and really a lot of it depends on the house. We encourage our clients to attend the inspection and look around yourself for any items or details that you may find interesting or have questions about. Chances are we will have it in our notes and will address them in our summary and report, but an active conversation can be beneficial for all involved. If you’d like to wait till the end to ask questions that’s fine too, either way we will be there for all of them.<br><br>

            &ensp; The inspection is also a great time to take measurements for appliances whether you're bringing your own or buying new. You can also plan where furniture might go and if you have questions about future remodels, just let us know, we're happy to give you our input.<br><br>
            
            &ensp;On the flip side of this, what do you do if you can’t make it to the inspection?  We will still complete our job and send over the report in a timely fashion.  After you and your Realtor review the report, if you have any questions, we are always willing to host a phone conference to go over the findings.  The same amount of support will be there whether you attend or not and regardless the report will have all the findings listed with photos and videos.  If time allows, sometimes we are able to phone/video conference while we are wrapping up the home inspection.

      <!-- Question 6 -->
      <div class="accordion-item">
        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="question6">
          <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#answer6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="answer6">
            Question 6:How Do I Choose a Good Home Inspector?
          </button>
        </h2>
        <div id="answer6" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="question6" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
          <div class="accordion-body">
            Answer 6:<br><br>&ensp; A good home inspector should review a house from top to bottom including all major structural components that he or she can get to.  Expect the infrastructure such as the plumbing, electrical, gas lines, and specific appliances to be tested.  The doors, windows, outlets, and even locks are typically all standard as well.  Chances are when the home inspection is complete, that home inspector will know more about your home than you would in 10 years of living there, so ask questions, read the report, and ask more questions if you have them.<br><br>

            &ensp;Information is power and ideally with this information you and your Realtor can make the proper decision whether the house is still right for you and if you would like to ask for something to be repaired.  One mistake most first-time home buyer’s make is not having a Sewer Scope or termite inspection.  Major sewer issues can add up into the $1,000’s, sometimes even reaching $15,000.  We are able to catch evidence of wood destroying organisms at times, but that is best left to the experts in their field.  Not only can they provide a more thorough inspection, but they are also able to generate a mitigation quote.
